FIXED;3.506;PATCH;
1. Added ground rudder control to the autonomous and SAS autopilot system. This will help to keep the aircraft in a straight line during augmented/autonomus takeoffs and landings.
The command heading (the heading this new logic will hold) is recorded when the aircraft wheels touches the ground either on scene start (for takeoff) or on landing.
